# Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js 

The Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js provides a powerful and easy to use API to interact with a Hyperledger fabric blockchain. The HFC is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime.

#### Overview and Deep Dive

* [Application Developer's Overview](app-overview.md) for a topological overview of applications and a blockchain.

* [Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js](node-sdk-indepth.md) the Node.js Client SDK in more depth

#### Development Environment Choices

* [Self Contained Node.js Environment](node-sdk-self-contained.md) uses pre-built docker images for the Node.js Client SDK application interacting with Hyperledger fabric blockchain. This environment may suffice for a majority of Node.js application developers. The environment contains a built-in standalone sample ready to go.
