While the contents of non-confidential transactions are open to all participants, the contents of confidential transactions are encrypted with secret keys known only to their originators, validators, and authorized auditors. Only holders of the secret keys can interpret transaction contents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5 id=\"what-if-none-of-the-stakeholders-of-a-business-contract-are-validators\">What if none of the stakeholders of a business contract are validators?</h5>\n<p>In some business scenarios, full confidentiality of contract logic may be required \u2013 such that only contract counterparties and auditors can access and interpret their chaincode. Under these scenarios, counter parties would need to spin off a new child chain with only themselves as validators.</p>",
