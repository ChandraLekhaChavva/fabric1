    "content": "<h1 id=\"contributions-welcome\">Contributions Welcome!</h1>\n<p>We welcome contributions to the Hyperledger Project in many forms, and\nthere&rsquo;s always plenty to do!</p>\n<p>First things first, please review the Hyperledger Project&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Hyperledger-Project-Code-of-Conduct\">Code of\nConduct</a>\nbefore participating. It is important that we keep things civil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-a-linux-foundation-account\">Getting a Linux Foundation account</h2>\n<p>In order to participate in the development of the Hyperledger Fabric project,\nyou will need an <a href=\"../Gerrit/lf-account/\">LF account</a>. This will give you single\nsign-on to all the community tools, including Gerrit and Jira (coming soon!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-help\">Getting help</h2>\n<p>If you are looking for something to work on, or need some expert assistance in\ndebugging a problem or working out a fix to an issue, our\n<a href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org/community\">community</a> is always eager to help. We\nhang out on <a href=\"https://hyperledgerproject.slack.com/\">Slack</a>, IRC (#hyperledger on\nfreenode.net) and the <a href=\"http://lists.hyperledger.org/\">mailing lists</a>. Most of us\ndon&rsquo;t bite ;-) and will be glad to help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements-and-use-cases\">Requirements and Use Cases</h2>\n<p>We have a <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Requirements-WG\">Requirements\nWG</a> that is\ndocumenting use cases and from those use cases deriving requirements. If you are\ninterested in contributing to this effort, please feel free to join the\ndiscussion in\n<a href=\"https://hyperledgerproject.slack.com/messages/requirements/\">slack</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-bugs\">Reporting bugs</h2>\n<p>If you are a user and you find a bug, please submit an\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues\">issue</a>. Please try to provide\nsufficient information for someone else to reproduce the issue. One of the\nproject&rsquo;s maintainers should respond to your issue within 24 hours. If not,\nplease bump the issue and request that it be reviewed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixing-issues-and-working-stories\">Fixing issues and working stories</h2>\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues\">issues list</a> and find\nsomething that interests you. You could also check the <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22\">&ldquo;help\nwanted&rdquo;</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-bug\">&ldquo;good first\nbug&rdquo;</a>\nlists. It is wise to start with something relatively straight forward and\nachievable. Usually there will be a comment in the issue that indicates whether\nsomeone has already self-assigned the issue. If no one has already taken it,\nthen add a comment assigning the issue to yourself, eg.: <code>I'll work on this\nissue.</code>. Please be considerate and rescind the offer in comments if you cannot\nfinish in a reasonable time, or add a comment saying that you are still actively\nworking the issue if you need a little more time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-a-local-clone-and-gerrit\">Working with a local clone and Gerrit</h2>\n<p>We are using <a href=\"https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/fabric\">Gerrit</a>\nto manage code contributions. If you are unfamiliar, please review <a href=\"../Gerrit/gerrit/\">this\ndocument</a> before proceeding.</p>\n<p>After you have familiarized yourself with <code>Gerrit</code>, and maybe played around with\nthe <code>lf-sandbox</code> project, you should be ready to set up your local <a href=\"../dev-setup/devenv/\">development\nenvironment</a>. We use a Vagrant-based approach to\ndevelopment that simplifies things greatly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coding-guidelines\">Coding guidelines</h2>\n<p>Be sure to check out the language-specific <a href=\"../Style-guides/go-style/\">style\nguides</a> before making any changes. This will ensure a\nsmoother review.</p>\n<h3 id=\"becoming-a-maintainer\">Becoming a maintainer</h3>\n<p>This project is managed under open governance model as described in our\n<a href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter\">charter</a>. Projects or sub-projects\nwill be lead by a set of maintainers. New projects can designate an initial set\nof maintainers that will be approved by the Technical Steering Committee when\nthe project is first approved. The project&rsquo;s maintainers will, from\ntime-to-time, consider adding or removing a maintainer. An existing maintainer\nwill post a patchset to the <a href=\"../MAINTAINERS/\">MAINTAINERS.md</a> file. If a\nmajority of the maintainers concur in the comments, the pull request is then\nmerged and the individual becomes a (or is removed as a) maintainer. Note that\nremoving a maintainer should not be taken lightly, but occasionally, people do\nmove on - hence the bar should be some period of inactivity, an explicit\nresignation, some infraction of the code of conduct or consistently\ndemonstrating poor judgement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"legal-stuff\">Legal stuff</h2>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each source file must include a license header for the Apache Software\nLicense 2.0. A template of that header can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/dev-setup/headers.txt\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This\napplies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same\napproach&mdash;the <a href=\"../docs/biz/DCO1.1.txt\">Developer&rsquo;s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)</a>&mdash;that\nthe Linux&reg; Kernel <a href=\"http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin\">community</a> uses to manage code contributions.</p>\n<p>We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include\na sign-off statement in the commit message.</p>\n<p>Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter\naccepts the DCO:</p>\n<pre><code>Signed-off-by: John Doe &lt;john.doe@hisdomain.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git\nrepository using <code>git commit -s</code>.</p>",
