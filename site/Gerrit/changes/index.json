These\nguidelines apply to developers that are new to open source, as well as\nto experienced open source developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"change-requirements\">Change Requirements</h2>\n<p>This section contains guidelines for submitting code changes for review.\nFor more information on how to submit a change using Gerrit, please\nsee <a href=\"../gerrit/\">Gerrit</a>.</p>\n<p>Changes are submitted as Git commits. Each commit must contain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a short and descriptive subject line that is 72 characters or fewer,\n  followed by a blank line.</li>\n<li>a change description with your logic or reasoning for the changes,\n  followed by a blank line</li>\n<li>a Signed-off-by line, followed by a colon (Signed-off-by:)</li>\n<li>a Change-Id identifier line, followed by a colon (Change-Id:). Gerrit won&rsquo;t\n  accept patches without this identifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A commit with the above details is considered well-formed.</p>\n<p>All changes and topics sent to Gerrit must be well-formed. Informationally,\n<code>commit messages</code> must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>what</strong> the change does,</li>\n<li><strong>why</strong> you chose that approach, and</li>\n<li><strong>how</strong> you know it works &ndash; for example, which tests you ran.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commits must <a href=\"../../dev-setup/build/\">build cleanly</a> when applied in top of each\nother, thus avoiding breaking bisectability. Each commit must address a single\nidentifiable issue and must be logically self-contained.</p>\n<p>For example: One commit fixes whitespace issues, another renames a\nfunction and a third one changes the code&rsquo;s functionality.  An example commit\nfile is illustrated below in detail:</p>\n<pre><code>A short description of your change with no period at the end\n\nYou can add more details here in several paragraphs, but please keep each line\nwidth less than 80 characters. A bug fix should include the issue number.\n\nFix Issue # 7050.\n\nChange-Id: IF7b6ac513b2eca5f2bab9728ebd8b7e504d3cebe1\nSigned-off-by: Your Name &lt;commit-sender@email.address&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each commit must contain the following line at the bottom of the commit\nmessage:</p>\n<pre><code>Signed-off-by: Your Name &lt;your@email.address&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The name in the Signed-off-by line and your email must match the change\nauthorship information. Make sure your :file:<code>.git/config</code> is set up\ncorrectly. Always submit the full set of changes via Gerrit.</p>\n<p>When a change is included in the set to enable other changes, but it\nwill not be part of the final set, please let the reviewers know this.</p>",
