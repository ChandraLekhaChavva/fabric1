The team is committed to continuously improving the performance and the scalability of the system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5 id=\"do-i-have-to-own-a-validating-node-to-transact-on-a-chain-network\">Do I have to own a validating node to transact on a chain network?</h5>\n<p>No. You can still transact on a chain network by owning a non-validating node (NV-node).</p>\n<p>Although transactions initiated by NV-nodes will eventually be forwarded to their validating peers for consensus processing, NV-nodes establish their own connections to the membership service module and can therefore package transactions independently. This allows NV-node owners to independently register and manage certificates, a powerful feature that empowers NV-node owners to create custom-built applications for their clients while managing their client certificates.</p>\n<p>In addition, NV-nodes retain full copies of the ledger, enabling local queries of the ledger data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5 id=\"what-does-the-error-string-state-may-be-inconsistent-cannot-query-as-a-query-result-mean\">What does the error string &ldquo;state may be inconsistent, cannot query&rdquo; as a query result mean?</h5>\n<p>Sometimes, a validating peer will be out of sync with the rest of the network. Although determining this condition is not always possible, validating peers make a best effort determination to detect it, and internally mark themselves as out of date.</p>\n<p>When under this condition, rather than reply with out of date or potentially incorrect data, the peer will reply to chaincode queries with the error string &ldquo;state may be inconsistent, cannot query&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In the future, more sophisticated reporting mechanisms may be introduced such as returning the stale value and a flag that the value is stale.</p>",
